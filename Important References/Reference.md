## Key Design Preferences

### Visual Aesthetic

**PRIMARY DIRECTION**: **Notan + Swiss Style Fusion**

A bold, sophisticated design system combining Japanese Notan principles (high-contrast positive/negative space) with Swiss Style precision (mathematical grids and typography). This creates a distinctive visual identity that communicates AI expertise through dramatic clarity.

**Core Aesthetic Qualities**:
- **Bold yet refined**: Dramatic black/white contrasts within precise grid structures
- **Professional authority**: Swiss mathematical precision conveys technical mastery
- **Memorable impact**: High-contrast compositions stand out from typical consultant sites
- **Timeless sophistication**: Both styles proven over 50+ years
- **Functional clarity**: Every design element serves information hierarchy


### Color Palette

**Primary Colors** (Notan Foundation):
- **Pure Black**: `#000000` - Authority, sophistication, technical mastery
- **Pure White**: `#FFFFFF` - Clarity, simplicity, clean solutions
- **Accent Blue**: `#0066FF` - Trust, intelligence, technology, innovation

**Supporting Grays** (Swiss Functional - UI only):
- `#1A1A1A` - Near black for subtle variations
- `#666666` - Mid gray for secondary text
- `#F5F5F5` - Near white for subtle backgrounds

**Usage Strategy**:
- Sections alternate pure black or pure white backgrounds
- Always high contrast: black text on white, white text on black
- Blue accent used sparingly for CTAs and emphasis only
- Grays only for UI elements that need subtle differentiation
- **Exceeds WCAG AAA**: Black/white contrast ratio 21:1


### Typography Mix

**Font Family** (Swiss Style):
- **Primary**: Helvetica Neue (classic Swiss typographic choice)
- **Alternative**: Inter or system fonts (modern, optimized for screens)
- **Rationale**: Sans-serif for clarity, professionalism, timeless quality

**Type Hierarchy** (Swiss Precision + Notan Scale):
- **H1 (Hero)**: 76-101px, Bold (900), Line-height 1.0 - Architectural impact
- **H2 (Sections)**: 43-57px, Bold (700), Line-height 1.1 - Clear delineation
- **H3 (Subsections)**: 32px, Semibold (600), Line-height 1.2 - Organization
- **Body Text**: 18px, Regular (400), Line-height 1.6 - Optimal readability
- **Captions**: 14px, Regular (400), Line-height 1.4 - Supporting info

**Typographic Principles**:
- Single font family, multiple weights for hierarchy
- Flush left, ragged right alignment (Swiss convention)
- Letter-spacing: -0.03em for large headlines, 0 for body
- Max line length: 65 characters (Swiss readability standard)
- Headlines as bold geometric shapes (Notan influence)


### Visual Style Keywords

**Primary Descriptors**:
- **Bold**: High-contrast compositions, confident statements
- **Precise**: Mathematical grids, perfect alignment, Swiss rigor
- **Minimal**: Elimination of all decoration, reduction to essence
- **Sophisticated**: Refined aesthetic, timeless modernism
- **Architectural**: Large-scale typography, geometric compositions
- **Authoritative**: Professional confidence through visual clarity

**Avoid**:
- Corporate-boring (generic blue/gray sameness)
- Agency-flashy (unnecessary animations or trendy effects)
- Cluttered (multiple colors, busy patterns)
- Soft/rounded (sharp geometric edges only)
- Decorative (no gradients, shadows, or ornament)

**Primary Value Proposition**:
"AI implementations that succeed through data quality excellence—I solve the #1 problem that determines success: solid data foundations"

- **Confident but not arrogant**: State capabilities directly without exaggeration
- **Practical over theoretical**: Focus on implementation realities and outcomes
- **Clear over clever**: Straightforward language, no jargon unless necessary
- **Results-oriented**: Emphasize client outcomes, not personal achievements
- **Technical but accessible**: Demonstrate expertise without intimidating non-technical clients

**Examples**:
- ✅ "I ensure AI implementations succeed by focusing on data quality—the #1 factor that determines outcomes"
- ❌ "I'm a thought leader in cutting-edge AI innovation" (too buzzword-heavy, not credible)
- ✅ "Database infrastructure expertise that keeps AI systems stable in production"
- ❌ "Years of experience in..." (factually inaccurate)
- ✅ "I've demonstrated ability to rapidly master new technologies and adapt to client contexts"
- ❌ "I'm just starting out in AI consulting but eager to learn" (too modest, undermines confidence)

**Writing Style**:
- Active voice, direct statements
- Specific examples over vague claims
- "I ensure..." not "I help..."
- Lead with client benefits, not personal background
- Technical credibility through specificity (database operations, data quality, pipeline development)
- Avoid: "passion for", "excited about", "journey", excessive qualifiers
